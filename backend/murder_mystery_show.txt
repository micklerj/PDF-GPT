YOUNG ANNA COLLIER: Tripp, give it back!

YOUNG TRIPP COLLIER: Aw, you’re never gonna get this back.

NANNY: Tripp, leave your sister alone!

RUFUS COTESWORTH: Pay attention.

YOUNG ANNA: I’m gonna kill you!

RUFUS: Details matter.

YOUNG TRIPP: Good luck.

RUFUS: If you want to solve a crime, any crime, you must first learn to see through the illusion.

KATHERINE COLLIER: She got suspended from school.

Stole a rare book from the library, first edition.

She’s been acting out since her mother died.

Which is completely understandable.

Maybe she’ll talk to you.

LAWRENCE COLLIER: She’s like a daughter to us.

All the resources of this family are at your disposal.

Celia Chun is using this to fuck with the offer, but [sighs] she’s just bluffing. I know she wants in.

Check these upper deck bars. These people got all your money.

Because I know.


She’s on our ship drinking our booze.

She wants in, so just give me the numbers that I want.

Has she convinced ’em?

Who, the board?

No, the Chuns. Don’t you work for her?

As an assistant in the marketing department, as you remind me constantly.

You know, I keep a screengrab of your adorable, little pay stub in my favorites folder.

Yeah, I know, Tripp.

You showed me at the holiday party.

Mm.

ANNA: for anything under eight.

You know that.

IMOGENE SCOTT: She’s rattled.

TRIPP: My sister? Terrified.

Give me the revised spreadsheet.

She’s gotta lock down this Chun money. Has to.

Mm! Olives. Thank you.

SERVER: Of course.

ANNA: And that’s last night, but we’ll see. Okay.

Hi, sorry. Work is just…

I’m being a bad friend.

No, it’s fine.

Did you, uh, d’you fix things?

Close that funding round?

It’s fine. Everything’s fine.


Good. Well, don’t worry about me. I’m happy just freeloading as per usual.

What? Imogene, please, you’re family.

Really glad you say that

because my room service bill last night was hilarious.

Ha-ha.

I wanted to thank you for the invite. I mean… what a treat!

“The world is ugly and the people are sad.”

Wallace Stevens wrote that, and he died in 1955, the lucky fuck.

Imagine if he saw the dumpster fire it is now.

But all that ugliness stays on shore.

When we sail these rolling waters, we leave the real world behind.

And let me tell you who paid for the privilege.

You all know Mr. Lawrence Collier by name and reputation.

He sails with his wife, Katherine, to celebrate his retirement.

Every guest aboard this vessel is important because every one of them is important to Mr. Lawrence Collier.

Their daughter, Anna, is expected to take over for her father as CEO of Collier Mills, but this is no simple case of nepotism.

Anna Collier is a shark.

They can’t come back and want to renege on terms that we already signed to. Just tell them no.

TEDDY GOH: Her wife, Leila Collier, a retired clickbait journalist, requested a room on the south side of the ship to avoid 5G contamination.

Leila has certain peculiarities. [slight chuckle]

Anna’s childhood friend, Imogene Scott, was taken in by the Collier family after her mother’s grisly murder.

Anna’s older brother, Lawrence the third, or Tripp, is a self-employed entrepreneur.

Hit me.

Goddammit! Motherfucker…

TEDDY: Tripp has launched many enterprises, all of which have failed.

What he has succeeded at is cocaine.

NURSE: Here’s your vitamin B12 IV drip.

TEDDY: Governor Alexandra Hochenberg of the state of Washington is up for reelection this fall.

She is a virtual shoo-in.

We’ve been working on this deal for over a year…

TEDDY: As might be expected, the Colliers always travel with their family lawyer.

After I got your dipshit son into Vassar?

TEDDY: The Collier entourage includes Father Toby Briggs, well-known political kingmaker.

Father Toby drags along his son, known to the world as That Derek.

Oh, yeah. These people rich.

TEDDY: That Derek is a rising TikTok star.

What up, baddies? It’s your boy, That Derek.

Surely, in his celestial manse, Wallace Stevens weeps for us all.

The Chun family operate a global fast-fashion empire overseen by matriarch Celia Chun.

Rumor has it the Chuns will announce a sizable investment in Collier Mills while they sail with us.

You may recognize their personal security detail, Rufus Cotesworth.

Once heralded as the World’s Greatest Detective, he has been brought low by circumstance.

[Rufus snoring]

TEDDY: And finally, rounding out our VIP guest list, is Mr. Keith Trubitsky of Indianapolis, Indiana.

Proof that money cannot buy taste, good looks, charm… or ability.

Fuck!


Our guests look to you… to transport them to a bygone era of beauty and style.

It is a spell we cast. Do not be the one to break it.

Dismissed.

[crew chatter indistinctly]

TEDDY: Winnie, do you know what the very best part of my job is?

Sunil lets me fire anyone I want.

You can’t fire me.

Not if you don’t want a lecture from Mum at New Year’s.

I worry.

There are temptations when you spend so much time around these people.

You start to think like them, you start to act like them.

But you can’t, because they have something that protects them everywhere they go.

And what is that?

Money.

The man’s a fucking hack.

This is a message from Celia Chun.

Yes.

Corporate due diligence.

It doesn’t mean anything.

You’re missing the point. She’s trying to intimidate us.

Well, then, Katherine, don’t let her.

It’s not me I’m worried about.

If he snoops around in the wrong place…

He’s a fucking hack!

We have information that could bury him. It would be mutually assured destruction.

Still, it’s bad form, and it shows the Chuns don’t trust us.

I’m gonna talk to Eleanor.

LLEWELLYN MATHERS: No, no.

If we look nervous, it means we have a reason to be nervous.

We just keep it tight.

Holy shit, that-that’s how they got in and out.

Possibly.

No, definitively.

Then the killer knows something about you, too.

They were hiding in Trubitsky’s suite.

They saw you make a hash of his timepiece, nick 600 quid.

If you see this through, it is possible that you will be in danger, that you already are.

Okay, so, so, if… No, if they rode out in the cart, where’d, where’d they go? Where’d they get off? Who saw them?

I can talk to the staff.

No, you don’t trust the staff.

I know what to do.

Enjoy the ride, did ya?

IMOGENE: Cart stopped four times. Twice on deck four.

Housekeeper dropped empty plates, but the doors were open into those suites, so, killer could’ve slipped into a room, maybe.

More likely, they got off here… [whispering] ’cause there’s no cameras.

Bit addictive, isn’t it?

That feeling… rushing through you.

[Rufus chuckles]

You know, I think we should go back to the security room.

There’s gotta be footage of…

Wait, you’ve already been to the security room.

You already saw the cart get wheeled out.

You already knew everything that I have just quote, unquote “figured out.”

I had a hunch.

What the fuck, man?

It’s more fun when you unravel it yourself.

I’m out.

Wait, I’m sorry. I tr… I tried…

[sighs] Imogene.

You’re good at this.

You’ve always been good at this.

Even when you were 10 years old, I could see you had a gift.

Was that before or after you spent all the Colliers’ money and then dropped my mom’s case?

You think that’s what happened?

Soon as they stopped paying, you quit.

It’s more complicated than that.

I was a kid, and you made me believe you were on my side.

I was.

I am.

And you were right.

There is a reason that you and I are on this ship together.

What reason is that?

I’m still trying to put the final piece in place.

You know, I think I’ve played your games long enough.

Then go.

Sleepwalk your way into the grave.

You will not leave a mark on this world if you do.

I have a name… Viktor Sams.

Does that mean anything to you?

LAWRENCE: No… Should it?

I traced components of the device that blew in your driveway.

Various parts purchased by a Viktor Sams.

Likely an alias.

Three months on this case and all you have is a fake name?

Not a fake, sir. An alias. [Lawrence sighs]

RUFUS: Question now is whose.

Well, I don’t have a goddamn clue, do I?

[footsteps retreating]

RUFUS: I know you’re in there.

Viktor Sams? That’s who killed my mom?

Now we just need to unmask him.

I’ll see this through… no matter what.

I promise.

Jules?

[sighs]

SUNIL: He’s workin’ the Gallipoli event.

Um… thanks.

I know that look.

You wanna punch somethin’ or… someone?

What are you even doing here?

It’d bore you. [chuckles]

Uh, it’s numbers-matching Chris Craft engine.

Right nightmare to maintain, but it sounds good.

Right, so this is why you’re single.

You’re in love with your toys.

Who said I was single?

Well, you cut your hair, day before we left?

Lost 10 pounds, recently.

Hopin’ to meet someone.

Or… she broke your heart.

She liked me better as a banker.

Oh.

She was a bitch. [both chuckling]

No, I… I wasn’t any fun.

And I was… angry.

I hated the whole ugly world.

Yeah, well, it’s perfectly hate-able.

It is.

So, I quit… and I put everything I own into making that ship, into making somethin’ perfect, somethin’ real.

Are you happy now?

[inhales] I have a purpose.

I know, it’s… it’s a bit odd. It’s hard to explain, but I, I think it all found me.

I just had to… step onto the path.

And leave your mark.

Yeah, exactly.

RUFUS: Pay attention. Details matter.

If you want to solve a crime, any crime, you must first learn to see through the illusion.

But you’ll never succeed with just one pair of eyes.

That’s why I always work with an assistant.

To dig out the truth behind every lie.

To wake you from a week-long drunk, if need be.

To sort the run-of-the-mill liar from the prime suspect.

Murdered in his stateroom… via harpoon gun, apparently.

Wait, Keith Trubitsky. Are ya sure?

LLEWELLYN: What I was told.

[speaking Mandarin]

[footsteps]

TEDDY: I’ve gathered all of the guests, save one.

Lawrence Collier?

His exact words were, “Fucking hack.”

We have a history.

I intuited that from context.

Would you like to begin questioning?

[glass clinking]

As you all know… a man has been murdered on this ship.

Killer is among us.

I’ve been studying each of you, and have learned… devastating facts.



RUFUS: I’m sorry.

YOUNG IMOGENE: You haven’t found Viktor Sams yet.

You aren’t finished!

But I am.

What about my mom?

You promised!

I should not have done that.

YOUNG IMOGENE: Don’t go. Please don’t go!

Please!

[crying]

RUFUS: I don’t like coincidences.

Trust nothing. No one.

I always work with an assistant. Read my book.

There is a reason that you and I are on this ship together.

Keith Trubitsky was your assistant?

That’s why you were on the Varuna? You were working a case?

Rufus!

What case?

I think you know.
